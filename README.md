📊 Battery Animation & CSV Plotter
This PyQt5-based application demonstrates a dynamic lithium-ion battery charging/discharging animation alongside a simple CSV plotter. It’s designed as a learning tool for visualizing battery behavior and plotting voltage vs. current data from CSV files.

✨ Features
✅ Battery Animation

Visually represents lithium-ion battery operation during charging and discharging.

Shows animated movement of lithium ions and electrons between anode and cathode.

✅ CSV Plotter

Load any CSV file with at least two numerical columns.

Plots voltage vs. current using Matplotlib.

✅ Interactive Controls

Start/stop charging and discharging using buttons.

Load CSV files and generate plots on demand.

🛠️ Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Battery Animation:

Click Start Charging or Start Discharging to see ions and electrons in action.

CSV Plotter:

Click Load CSV File and select a CSV with at least two numerical columns.

The app will plot the first column on the X-axis (Voltage) and the second on the Y-axis (Current).

📌 Notes
CSV files should have at least two numerical columns to plot.

Adjust the application window size as needed to view all components.

💡 Future Improvements
Add labels and legends to plots for clarity.

Save plots as images or export analyzed data.

Integrate additional battery states or chemistries.
